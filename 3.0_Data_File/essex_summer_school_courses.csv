If taken in conjunction with another course, there is no extra charge. Christopher Saker is a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Manager of the Essex Further Mathematics Centre. His research interests lie in the combinatorics of words, particularly the study of unavoidable sets. Course Objectives This course is intended for those with little recent mathematical experience but who are motivated to learn. The aim is to provide a service course in support of other Summer School courses (primarily in the analysis of quantitative data) by presenting a unified introduction to the mathematical ideas and techniques used in those courses. The structure of the course is arranged, firstly, to provide an introduction to the concepts and techniques for the practical side of the subject, and, secondly, to develop a more deeper understanding of the ways in which these concepts and techniques are connected. Summer School participants may take any one Part and/or all three Parts of the course, but anyone taking Parts 2 or 3 will be presumed to be familiar with the material covered in the preceding Parts. Course Content Part 1 of the course is an introductory module which begins by reviewing the equations and graphs of straight lines and simple curves. It progresses to the study of functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions. The session concludes with an introduction to differentiation and some of its applications Course Prerequisites Participants in the course should be familiar with the basic ideas of arithmetic and algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, use of brackets, positive, negative, fractional powers, and the solution of simple equations). Students should possess a basic scientific calculator. Recommended Reading For a review of the concepts listed in the prerequisites we recommend the Algebra Refresher which can be found by following the revision booklets link from mathcentre.ac.uk.

1B Introduction to Quantitative Text Analysis,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/1b/,"Please note: This course will be taught online only. In person study is not available for this course. Martijn Schoonvelde is Assistant Professor in European Politics & Society at the University of Groningen. His main research and teaching interests are political communication, political rhetoric, and quantitative text analysis. Course Content With the explosion of digital text data, social scientists are increasingly leveraging sophisticated quantitative text analysis techniques to learn from these data. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to cutting-edge methods and tools in the field of âtext-as-dataâ. We discuss substantive applications of these methods, their theoretical assumptions, and their implementation in the R statistical programming language. The meetings â which combine lectures and coding sessions â will be hands-on, dealing with practical issues in each step of a text as data project. Course Objectives Participants will understand fundamental issues in quantitative text analysis research design such as different types of textual representations; measurement versus prediction; multilingualism; and how to think about validation. Participants will learn to convert texts into informative feature matrices and to analyze those matrices using statistical methods. Participants will learn to apply these methods to a text corpus in support of a substantive research question. Furthermore, participants will be able to critically evaluate (social science) research that uses automated text analysis methods. Course Prerequisites Familiarity with basic research design and statistical analysis is expected, and familiarity with the R statistical programming language is encouraged.

1G Longitudinal and Panel Data Analysis,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/1g-longitudinal-and-panel-data-analysis/,"Please note: This course will be taught in hybrid mode. Hybrid delivery of courses will include synchronous live sessions during which on campus and online students will be taught simultaneously. Mark Pickup is a professor in the Department of Political Science at Simon Fraser University. He is a specialist in Political Behaviour, Political Psychology and Political Methodology. Substantively, his research primarily falls into three areas: political identities and political decision-making; conditions of democratic responsiveness and accountability; and polls and electoral outcomes. His research focuses on political information, public opinion, political identities, norms and election campaigns within North American and European countries. His methodological interests concern the analysis of longitudinal data (time series, panel, network, etc.) with secondary interests in Bayesian analysis and survey/lab experiment design. Â His work has appeared in, among others,Â American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, British Journal of Political Science, Political Analysis, Electoral Studies, Political Behavior,Â and Canadian Journal of Political Science. He is also the author of Introduction to Time Series in the Sage Publications, Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series. Course description Statistical models can be applied to longitudinal data. Chronological sequences of observations âtime series dataâ allow us to examine the movement of social science variables over time (e.g., public opinion, government policy, judicial decisions, socioeconomic measures), allowing analysts to estimate relationships between variables and test hypotheses. Data collected over both units (e.g., survey respondents, states, countries) and time (e.g., days, months, years) âpanel dataâ are common in the social sciences. By gaining leverage across units and over time, these data help us answer important questions that would be difficult if we only looked at a single point in time (e.g., cross section). Despite these advantages, longitudinal data often show forms of heterogeneity as well as temporal and spatial dependence that make standard regression approaches inappropriate. The course will provide a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental concepts in time series analysis, including: autoregressive, moving-average and unit-root processes; trending, cycling and structural breaks; weak dependence; and the three most important assumptions underlying longitudinal estimates of models, stationarity, exogeneity and balance. It will also provide a broad understanding of panel data analysis, including: the structure and properties of panel data; spatio-temporal dependence; approaches to addressing spatial heterogeneity, such as random and fixed effects; and testing for and modeling dynamics. Throughout, we will also discuss several smaller topics in longitudinal data. A sound background in linear regression models is assumed but prior training in longitudinal data analysis is not required. The course will make use of basic algebra. The lab component of this course will employ Stata. Some familiarity with Stata would be helpful but for those without that familiarity, labs notes will provide a brief introduction.

1H Qualitative Data Analysis: Methodologies for Analysing Text and Talk,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/1h/,"Please note: This course will be delivered in person at the Colchester campus. Online study is not available for this course. Lea Sgier spends part of her time teaching qualitative methods and doing research at the Department of Political Science of the University of Geneva (Switzerland). In the remaining time, she works as an independent research methods and research ethics consultant (currently for various European and Swiss research projects; LISER in Luxemburg, and for the evaluation company Evalux). She is also an instructor for a number of graduate programmes across the world (Essex SS, Hong Kong SS, Concordia University (Montreal) Methods Workshops, ENS (Paris), EPFL and CUSO Programmes in Switzerland etc.). She has also worked in capacity building functions (for LISER in Luxemburg and in international research cooperation with the Western Balkans and the South Caucasus). From 2010-17, she was an assistant professor in qualitative methodology at (US accredited) Central European University (CEU) in Budapest. Research wise, she has just completed a project (with Barbara Lucas, HETS GenÃ¨ve; Leenaards Foundation 2017-21) on institutionalised elderly peopleâs relation to politics and voting in French-speaking Switzerland, a project that involved small-scale ethnographic observation, qualitative interviews, an institutional survey and a legal analysis. Previously, she worked on gender issues in politics and on Â comparative old age and dementia policy. Â Course Content This is a course centred mainly on the analysis of textual data in an interpretive spirit. The main emphasis is on exploring various approaches to qualitative data analysis and interpretation, from thematic analysis and the logic of formalized âcodingâ, to interpretative approaches such as discourse and narrative analysis. We will discuss how each of these methods reveals different aspects of the data and is grounded in different research perspectives. We will review the nature, strengths and limits of various approaches and get acquainted with their practicalities through a series of practical exercises. We will also explore the implications of various types of analysis on the data generation stage, for qualitative interviewing in particular, and reflect upon issues such as appropriate topic guides, interviewing techniques and transcription practices. (This is not a full course on interviewing though, only the aspects directly connected to the data analysis stage will be discussed). Particular attention will also be given to the writing-up stage of qualitative analysis and its difficulties. Other topics to be addressed are the epistemological foundations of qualitative research, validity and reliability issues, as well as issues of interpretative authority and research ethics. The course consists of lectures and practical exercises. Participants will be invited to hand in various pieces of data analysis in the course of the two weeks. They will have the opportunity to work on their own data if they wish. Course Objectives The aim of this course is to familiarize participants with the practical application of qualitative data analysis, with an emphasis on interpretative methods. At the end of the course, participants will understand the implications of applying various methods to textual and interview data. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve a more sophisticated and critical attitude towards data, the research process and research reports. This is not an introductory course to qualitative methodology in general, but a doctoral-level course that focuses mostly on (textual) data analysis. It is suitable mainly for two types of participants: participants already engaged in research requiring textual analysis who are moving towards the data analysis stage and need to acquire some analytical tools for this; and participants at earlier stages of their research who wish to gain a general understanding of various approaches to textual analysis.

His main research and teaching interests are civil military relations, conflict resolution and management, environmental politics, international cooperation, migration, party politics and spatial analysis.Â Course Content This course offers an application-oriented introduction to maximum likelihood (ML) based models for categorical, discrete choice, and count data. We begin with the basics of ML estimation and a discussion of the theoretical foundations of categorical, discrete choice, and count-data models. We then focus on exploring logistic and probit regression models and learn how to apply them in the statistical software package Stata. Afterwards, we cover interpretation and hypothesis for testing these kinds of models. Against this background, we will consider more complicated estimation strategies, including ordered logit and probit regression models, multinomial logits, count models, or discrete duration models. The course concludes with an overview of advanced techniques of models for time-series cross-section (TSCS) categorical, discrete choice, and count data. Course Objectives After this course, participants will be able to understand models for categorical, discrete choice, and count data most commonly used in the social sciences, and properly apply and interpret these models in their own work. Course Prerequisites Participants are assumed to have a basic knowledge of multiple linear regression. Some familiarity with linear algebra and experience estimating regression models with statistical software might also be helpful, but not essential to success in the course.

Rabiaâs research has appeared in The Journal of Politics, The British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies and Legislative Studies Quarterly. Course description and goals: This course introduces participants to the analysis of quantitative data both theoretically and empirically. Introductory quantitative methods will be covered along with an introduction to the free, open-source software R. R is a highly versatile software environment suitable for introductory and advanced quantitative social science and data analysis. The course offers participants a near-complete foundation for introductory quantitative analysis and to use R for all commonly encountered tasks in social science data analytics. The primary goal of the course is to equip participants with the tools necessary to conduct their own data analysis independently. To do so, the course will cover relevant statistical and descriptive techniques with a strong focus on applied skills and data visualization that will be introduced using R. The course will cover various topics, both theoretically and in R, including the following: â Introduction to R and programming in R â Descriptive statistics â Data visualization with advanced R packages â Data import and management, including working with âmessyâ datasets â Variable types and creating new variables in R â Data uncertainty â Correlations and causal relationships â Linear regressions, assumptions, interpretation â Non-linear relationships in OLS â Binary dependent variables Course Objectives:Upon successful completion of the course, participants will be able to consume quantitative texts for social science, download and manage messy datasets, describe and visualize various sorts of data, conduct their own statistical analyses, and use R for most commonly encountered tasks in social science data analysis. Participants will leave with the knowledge of a range of introductory statistical techniques and the ability to implement these in their own research. They will also be comfortable using R for descriptive and statistical analyses, and for managing complex datasets. The course is most suitable for researchers at the beginning of their quantitative training though those with existing background in quantitative social sciences wishing to acquire a new, free, open- source, and highly versatile set of tools (in R) will also benefit. Participants will also learn to incorporate data analysis and document creation (via R Markdown). Course Prerequisites: Participants are advised to have a basic background in introductory statistics or concurrently be enrolled in an introductory statistics course. However, initial exposure to statistical techniques up to linear regression (at a fundamental level) is not required as the course will go through necessary background concepts as well. No background in R or computer programming is required or expected. The course introduces R from a beginnerâs perspective.

His current research explores discourses and practices in grassroots welfare provisioning and community development. For more details please see here: https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/rouss97802/konstantinos-roussos JimenaÂ Vazquez Garcia is a lecturer in the Government Department at the University of Essex. Previously, she was post-doctoral researcher at Anglia Ruskin University. She holds a PhD in Ideology and Discourse Analysis from the University of Essex and is a member of the Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis. Her research focuses on theories of political subjectivation and critique in Michel Foucaultâs thought. Her current interests revolve around ideas of care, digital subjectivities and counter-hegemonic practices. Course Content Â A central claim of discourse theory is that meaning, subjectivity, and agency are constructed within relational structures that are shaped and re-shaped through political struggle. This course introduces the basic concepts of poststructuralist discourse theory, understood as a distinctive, qualitative approach to critical empirical research. The course situates this approach in relation to competing approaches to social and political analysis that take discourse and meaning seriously, and contextualises it also in relation to key debates in the philosophy of natural and social science. The main aim of the course, however, is to address the challenging question of âapplyingâ discourse theory to empirical phenomena in the name of understanding, explanation, and critique. Drawing inspiration from poststructuralism and psychoanalysis, it serves as a forum to discuss research strategies that are consonant with the field of discourse theory, and outlines conceptual frameworks that can be employed in the analysis of concrete discourses and practices. A range of concepts and themes are examined with particular reference to the work of thinkers such as Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Judith Butler, Antonio Gramsci, Wendy Brown, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek. Such concepts and themes are considered from the point of view of methodology and research strategy, and include discourse and practice, hegemony and antagonism, politics and dislocation, performativity and subjectivity, fantasy and ideology, feminism and the commons, populism and radical democracy. It uses empirical cases to illustrate broad methodological and theoretical points, from general considerations regarding qualitative methods appropriate to poststructuralist discourse theory, to more focused considerations of rhetorical, ethnographic, participatory, and psycho-social dimensions of research, including the place and role of the analyst in the process of research. The illustrations will focus on the emergence and hegemonic consolidation of neoliberal discourses and practices in different contexts; the logic and functioning of policy discourses; the rise and character of populist movements and other forms of radical democratic politics; the role of organizational, media and digital practices in contemporary capitalism; the character of urban regimes and novel forms of commoning; and more besides. As part of this course participants are invited to present and thematise their own research topics and proposals Discussion of Participantâs Research Projects Participants are encouraged to submit a short 1,500 word outline of their own research interests and projects, and the sorts of challenges being faced, methodological or otherwise. Outlines should be emailed to David Howarth (davidh@essex.ac.uk), Konstantinos Roussos (k.roussos@essex.ac.uk) and Jimena Vazquez (j.vazquezgarcia@essex.ac.uk) and headed âEssex Summer Schoolâ, at least one week before the start of the course, so that they can be built into the programme. Time is allocated at the end of the course for collective discussion of participant research topics and proposals. Course Aims & Objectives Participants will become familiar with the basic assumptions, concepts and logics of poststructuralist discourse theory, exploring their implications for conducting social and political analysis and analyzing policy discourses. At the end of the course, participants will: â¢ be conversant with major literatures and debates in the field of discourse analysis; â¢ have acquired a solid grounding in poststructuralist discourse theory and its application to social and political analysis and critique; â¢ be well-grounded in theoretical and methodological issues arising in this field; â¢ be familiar with key dimensions of critical empirical research relevant to the design of a research strategy in this field; â¢ be able to conduct independent theoretical and empirical research in the field of discourse analysis, focussed on the location of puzzles, the problematization of relevant literatures, the construction of research questions, and the gathering and analysis of data; â¢ finish with a keen sense of the critical role that discourse plays both in theory and in social and political practice.

1C Introduction to Regression,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/1c-applying-regression/,"Please note: This course will be taught online only. In person study is not available for this course. Tor Georg Jakobsen is a Professor in Political Science at the NTNU Business School. He is co-author (with Mehmet Mehmetoglu) of Applied Statistics using Stata: A Guide for the Social Sciences (Sage 2016) and has authored and co-authored numerous articles in, among others, European Sociological Review, Work, Employment & Society, Regional Studies, and Conflict Management & Peace Science. His research interest includes political behavior, sports economics, and statistical methods. Jakobsen is also winner of the 2020 Bernard Brodie Prize (together with Jo Jakobsen). He has taught quantitative courses at all levels. Course Content This course covers regression analysis, both with continuous, ordinal, and categorical dependent variables. The focus will be on applied regression analysis, yet we will also deal with related topic like data treatment in Stata, interpretations, and how to test regression assumptions. The course includes ordinary least squares regression, logistic, ordinal, and multinomial regression, how to model and interpret non-linear effects as well as different types of statistical interactions. We will also focus on how to deal with breaches of assumptions. Course Objectives The course will enable the students to perform a range of regression models, to work with data treatment, and to be able to critically evaluate and interpret different types of regression models. Course Prerequisites The students should have some knowledge about basic descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency and spread. It is also good to have some knowledge about the statistical software Stata. However, instruction and notes will be made available, so it is possible for everyone to follow (though you must work harder if you do not have previous knowledge). The course will, to a large degree, follow the structure of the book Applied Statistics using Stata. In the reading list are also included short Sage books from the series Quantitative Application in the Social Sciences that dwell deeper into the topics of logistic regression and missing data (note that these are not Stata-books but deals more with statistical theory). In the recommended readings section, I have included to Stata introduction books for those who are not very comfortable with this software (you only need one of these), as well as a book on dummy variables and some additional chapters in our main book. Course material The students will have access to lectures, computer lab assignments, and datasets. The former two are also available as video-recordings (links to the lectures and computer instructions will be provided). There will be one topic each day, with a combination of online teaching with a following computer lab for each lecture (both will be through Zoom). Be aware that even though the course is divided into 10 topics, some topics require more work than others (especially topic #3). Required Texts Mehmetoglu, Mehmet & Tor G. Jakobsen (2022).

John Barry Ryan is an associate professor at the University of Michigan with a joint appointment in the Departments of Political Science and Communication and Media. He studies political campaign communication, social influence, and public opinion. His latest co-authored books are The Other Divide and Partisan Hostility and American Democracy. Course Content The focus of this course is studying social influence. Standard statistical models and survey measures implicitly assume that individuals are atomistic and come to their attitudes without influence from others individuals â who might also be in the dataset. There are various techniques for overcoming these assumptions and studying individuals as interdependent members of a social group. Social network analysis considers the entire network â a population of connected people. This methods requires a different conceptualization of what is a âcaseâ in a dataset. It also requires a particular dataset that can be hard to obtain. For this reason, we will also examine alternative means for studying social influence using surveys and experimental methods. Course Objectives At the end of the course, participants should be able to: â¢ Collect social network data for studying public opinion. â¢ Calculate summary statistics for a network. â¢ Produce network graphs in R. â¢ Design surveys for studying influence without using social network analysis. Course Prerequisites Course participants who want to take part in the hands-on analysis components of the course will benefit from having some familiarity with R, but it is not required.

Hybrid delivery of courses will include synchronous live sessions during which on campus and online students will be taught simultaneously. Rob Johns is Professor of Politics in the Department of Politics & International Relations at the University of Southampton. He has taught at the Essex Summer School since 2012. Robâs research is in the fields of public opinion, political psychology and questionnaire design. He has run several major survey projects and published numerous articles and books based on analyses of public opinion data. Current research explores the connections between mental health and political attitudes, citizensâ understanding of and reactions to the notion of human rights, the drivers of support for Scottish independence, and public perceptions of the distinction between facts and opinions. Course Content This course is a guide to designing, implementing and analysing a survey. It covers all the key decisions that survey researchers have to make: how to measure complex concepts, how to reduce bias in question design, how to choose a sample and access respondents, and how to adjust for non-response. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which real-world surveys often have to deviate from the pure methodology of the textbook, and use the participantsâ own data collections to illustrate how this need not be a major problem. This is largely a classroom-based course but there will be some lab work during which participants will work with the market-leading survey platform Qualtrics, and some group activity during which participants will design their own and evaluate each othersâ questionnaires. Course Objectives The straightforward objective of this course is to equip participants with the theoretical insights and practical knowledge needed to run their own survey. By understanding both the ideals of unbiased data collection and the ways in which real-world surveys tend to deviate from that ideal, participants will also become adept at evaluating their own and othersâ survey designs and analyses. These skills are greatly prized by employers, given the omnipresence of surveys, as well as being essential for those planning surveys for their own academic or other research. Participants will also acquire a detailed working knowledge of Qualtrics, one of the more versatile and popular platforms for designing and fielding online surveys. In addition to boosting participantsâ current skills, this course also serves as a springboard for the course in Advanced Survey Data Analysis and Survey Experiments typically available in Session 2 of the Essex Summer School. Course Prerequisites This is an introductory course. Participants are not assumed to have taken any previous class in survey methodology and there will also be a full introduction to Qualtrics, the survey design platform we use. Nor are participants required to do any prior reading.Â Those who would like a sneak preview of the topics and debates covered could look over one of the following (or one of the numerous other survey methodology texts available): Eichhorn, J.

My research expertise lies in the experiences of ageing, human development, social care, therapeutic communication, end of life care, mental health, and grief, loss and bereavement. I worked at the UK Data Archive for nine years (2005-2014), developing expertise in archiving, digitisation, research ethics, data reuse, and research data management. I am highly experienced in social care research ethics, particularly the ethics of researching at risk populations and on sensitive research topics.

I have published extensively including the monograph The Child-Parent Caregiving Relationship in Later Life: Psychosocial Experiences (Policy Press, 2023) and co-authored a methods textbook How to Do Qualitative Interviewing (SAGE, 2022) with Dr Katy Wheeler. Course Content This intensive one-week course aims to introduce participants to the most widely used qualitative research technique in the social sciences â the interview. The course is intended to systematically guide participants through the research process specific to a qualitative interview project, from research design through to conducting interviews, analysing them and writing up the findings. The course will focus on different types of qualitative interview â including in-depth interviews, psycho-social/sensitive interviews and expert interviews. We reflect on the different techniques at an interviewerâs disposal to encourage participants to share their stories and reflexively discuss how interactions between interviewer and interviewee shape the data that is generated. This is a practical course and participants will gain first-hand experience of conducting and analysing qualitative interviews of different types, as well as critically reflecting upon their own interviewing practice (assumptions and techniques). There will be space for participants to bring their questions about interviews to the course for group discussion. The course begins with an overview of the key principles and theoretical assumptions underlying the qualitative interview before moving onto the practicalities of setting up an interview research project. Participants are asked to collectively devise an interview guide, test out this guide and then conduct an in-depth interview with another summer school participant. Specific techniques/tools for approaching sensitive topics and dealing with elite interviewees are then considered. Psychosocial interviews are introduced as a special category of qualitative interview and participants can experience this approach through practical exercises. Using the qualitative data analysis software MAXQDA, we introduce techniques for analysing interview data before we conclude the course with top tips on writing up interview research. Course objectives The aim of this course is to equip participants with the skills and confidence to conduct their own research projects using qualitative interviews. The course is introductory so it is well-suited for participants who are at the beginning of their research, but it will also appeal to those who are already using qualitative interviews and are seeking to deepen their knowledge and skills (perhaps in terms of how to ask the right questions and deal with difficult or sensitive topics/participants). By the end of the course, participants should understand the principles behind and practicalities of doing a research project based on qualitative interviews.

His work has been published in the American Journal of Political Science, Political Analysis, and the British Journal of Political Science. He is also co-author of the book Analyzing Spatial Models of Choice and Judgment (second edition) Course content Python is a powerful object-oriented, general-purpose programming language for collecting, organizing, and analyzing a wide array of data types. Alongside the R statistical computing platform, it provides one of the best tools available for social scientists looking to employ cutting-edge data science in their own research. This course covers the basics of the Python programming environment with a focus on data science applications: object manipulation, web scraping, data visualization, elementary statistical methods, text analysis, and introductory machine learning tools. Course objectives This course is designed so that participants become comfortable working in the general Python environment while simultaneously learning about specific applications of Python to common social science research projects and tasks. Students will learn how to work with various data types and structures (including text), collect original data using web scraping/API tools, write and execute functions, produce data visualizations, and run popular machine learning algorithms (such as random forests) in Python. In doing so, students will gain familiarity with Pythonâs NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn libraries. Course Prerequisites While experience with an object-oriented programming language (e.g., R) is valuable, this course is designed to be introductory and programming experience is neither required nor assumed. We will focus on Python from a social scienceârather than a computer scienceâperspective. Hence, students should have some prior experience with basic statistical concepts and methods such as linear regression. Proficiency in calculus or other mathematics, while helpful, is not required.

2E Multilevel Models: Practical Applications,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/2e-multilevel-models-practical-applications/,"Please note: This course will be taught online only. In person study is not available for this course.Â Andrew Bell is Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Social Sciences at the Sheffield Methods Institute at the University of Sheffield. Before moving to Sheffield, Andy was a lecturer at the University of Bristol, where he also completed his undergraduate degree (in Geography) and PhD (in Advanced Quantitative Methods). His current substantive research focuses on mental health from a life course perspective, but also spans a diverse range of other subject areas, including geography, political science, social epidemiology and economics. Methodologically, Andyâs interests are in the development and application of multilevel models, with work focusing on age-period-cohort analysis and fixed and random effects models. Overview This course is an applied introduction to multilevel modelling that aims to give you deep understanding of the standard model. It does not presume any prior knowledge in multilevel modelling but does require you to be very familiar with multiple regression analysis. Course Content Populations commonly exhibit complex structure with many levels, so that patients (level 1) are assigned to clinics (level 2); while individuals (1) may âlearnâ their health-related behaviour in the context of households (2) and local cultures (3). In many cases, the survey design reflects the population structure, so in a survey of voting intentions respondents (1) are clustered by constituencies (2). Multilevel models are currently being applied to a growing number of social science research areas, including educational and organisational research, epidemiology, voting behaviour, sociology, and geography. Data at different levels are often seen as a convenience in the design which is a nuisance in the analysis. However, by using multilevel models we can model simultaneously at several levels, gaining the potential for improved estimation, valid inference, and a better substantive understanding of the realities of social organisation. In the first week of the course, and building on standard single-level models, we develop the two-level model with continuous predictors and response. Examples include house-prices varying over districts, and pupil progress varying by school. In the second week, these models are extended to cover complex variation, both within and between levels, three-level models, and models with categorical predictors and response (the multilevel logit model). We end with a consideration of estimators including maximum likelihood operationalized through iterative generalised least squares. Throughout the course, we shall use graphical examples, verbal equations, algebraic formulation, class-based model interpretation, and practical modelling using either the software package MLwiN or R, depending on the studentâs preference and past experience. We use these packages because of their flexibility, graphics capability and the possibilities of estimating model via maximum likelihood and MCMC methods. Course Objectives On completion of the course, participants will be able to recognise a multilevel structure, specify a multilevel model with complex variation at a number of levels, and fit and interpret a range of multilevel models. The course does not cover multilevel analysis of panel data, multivariate responses, or survival data, although the course does provide the essential groundwork for these extensions. This course is appropriate if you are analysing a survey with complex structure, are interested in the importance of contextual questions, or if you need to undertake a quantitative performance review of an organisation. A distinctive feature of the course is the focus on variance functions estimated simultaneously as several levels. Course Prerequisites This is not an introductory course to statistical modelling, as participants require familiarity with regression modelling and inferential statistics, especially regression intercepts and slopes, standard errors, t-ratios, residuals, and the concepts of variance and co-variance. Even so, the aim is not to cover mathematical derivations and statistical theory, but to provide a conceptual framework and âhands-onâ experience. It does not require prior knowledge of multilevel modelling. Students choosing to conduct practical exercises in R should have a moderate level of experience using R; no past experience of the software is required for those choosing to use MLwiN.

Both courses seek to introduce core aspects of multilevel models as well as covering selected extension topics associated with more advanced specifications. 1E tries to take a more introductory approach with regard to how statistical models are specified and how multilevel models link with other types of statistical model, and it includes some wider topics about strategies for dealing with complex data aside from using multilevel models; 2E goes a little further on statistical details and estimation strategies for multilevel models, and seeks to ground its methodological examples in detailed discussions of research applications. Both courses feature software examples but 1E is weighted towards Stata examples, with lighter coverage of R, SPSS and MLwiN; 2E makes most use of MLwiN and R, with some additional illustration of Stata. Some students choose to take both courses â if doing so, there will be some reiteration of some content, but there are plenty of detailed materials in both courses that point in different directions."

Iulia is a computational social scientist who studies the effects of social media and online information exposure on political competition and polarization using natural language processing and quantitative text analysis, machine learning and survey experiments. She holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University and an M.A. from Central European University. Before joining the University of Bath, she was a research fellow in the Q-Step Centre for Quantitative Social Sciences at the University of Exeter, and a teaching fellow in the LSE Department of Methodology. Â Course content Our world is increasingly being recorded as digital text, capturing human knowledge and interactions to an unprecedented level and providing a rich source of data for researchers across different academic disciplines and subjects. Consequently, computational text analysis methods and tools are becoming increasingly popular and starting to make their way into the core research methods curriculum. This course is designed to provide social science researchers an entry point to computational text analysis. Participants will gain hands-on experience designing and implementing a quantitative text analysis research project and will learn to discuss, evaluate and interpret the results. Each class consists of a 2-hours lecture followed by a 1.5 hours lab in which participants apply the methods covered in the lecture in R. We will start with an overview of computational text analysis methods and discuss examples of their application across multiple disciplines and research fields. We will then survey the main ways in which text data can be acquired and present several major online text data sources. The first steps in a text analysis research project â covering imputing, importing, manipulating and storing text data under different formats, as well as cleaning and processing it â often prove to be the most challenging for beginners. After addressing this initial set of issues we will study: the main ways in which text data can be turned into numbers; descriptive methods such as frequency tables and word clouds; automated dictionary methods (such as those developed to extract different emotions from text); text comparison methods (which are often used to study the diffusion and evolution of laws, policies and ideas); and text scaling methods (such as those used by political scientists to map the positions of political actors in the ideological space). Finally, the course provides an introduction to machine learning applied to text data: supervised classification (routinely used in multiple disciplines to label large volumes of text documents based on a small subset of coded data) and unsupervised learning methods (as a very light introduction to topic modelling). Course objectives At the end of the course, participants will have an understanding of the current quantitative text analysis research landscape, the ways in which computational text analysis can be applied to their area of interest and the main data sources, tools and methods available for further exploration. Participants will also gain hands-on experience designing and implementing a quantitative text analysis research project in R and will be able to discuss and interpret the results and acknowledge the limitations of the methods used.

"2I Applying Discourse Theory – Politics, Ideology, Populism",https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/2i-applying-discourse-theory/,"Please note: Please note: This course will be delivered in person at the Colchester campus only. Online study is not available for this course. Jason Glynos teaches political theory at the Department of Government, University of Essex, where he is co-director of the Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis. He has published widely in the areas of poststructuralist political theory and Lacanian psychoanalysis, focusing on theories of ideology, democracy, and freedom, and the philosophy and methodology of social science. He is co-author with David Howarth of Logics of Critical Explanation in Social and Political Theory (Routledge), co-editor with Yannis Stavrakakis of Politics and the Unconscious (Special Issue of Subjectivity, 2010), and co-editor of Discourse Theory: Ways Forward (Special Issue of Language and Politics, 2021). For more details, see: https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/GLYNO96709/Jason-Glynos. Yannis Stavrakakis is professor of political discourse analysis at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. His research focuses primarily on contemporary political theory (with emphasis on psychoanalytic and poststructuralist approaches) and on the analysis of ideology and discourse in late modern societies (with emphasis on populism, environmentalism, post-democracy and the role of artistic practices). He was one of the founding co-conveners of the Populism Specialist Group of the Political Studies Association (UK) and since 2014 he is directing the POPULISMUS Observatory: www.populismus.gr He has published numerous books and articles on psychoanalysis, political theory and populism. For more details, see: https://auth.academia.edu/YannisStavrakakis Module Content: A central claim of discourse theory is that meaning, subjectivity, and agency are constructed within relational structures that are shaped and re-shaped through political struggle. This course introduces the basic concepts of poststructuralist discourse theory, understood as a distinctive, qualitative approach to critical empirical research. The course situates this approach in relation to competing approaches to social and political analysis that take discourse and meaning seriously, and contextualises it also in relation to key debates in the philosophy of natural and social science. The main aim of the course, however, is to address the challenging question of âapplyingâ discourse theory to empirical phenomena in the name of understanding, explanation, and critique. Drawing inspiration from poststructuralism and psychoanalysis, it serves as a forum to discuss research strategies that are consonant with the field of discourse theory, and outlines conceptual frameworks that can be employed in the analysis of concrete discourses and practices. A range of concepts and themes are examined with particular reference to the work of thinkers such as Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Antonio Gramsci, Michel Foucault, and Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek. Such concepts and themes are considered from the point of view of methodology and research strategy, and include discourse and practice, hegemony and antagonism, politics and dislocation, performativity and subjectivity, fantasy and ideology, democracy and populism. It uses empirical cases to illustrate broad methodological and theoretical points, from general considerations regarding qualitative methods appropriate to poststructuralist discourse theory, to more focused considerations of rhetorical, ethnographic, participatory, and psycho-social dimensions of research, including the place and role of the analyst in the process of research. The illustrations draw on organizational and media practices, policy discourses, populist movements, and more besides. As part of this course participants are invited to present and thematise their own research topics and proposals. Discussion of Participantâs Research Projects: Participants are encouraged to submit a short 1,500 word outline of their own research interests and projects, and the sorts of challenges being faced, methodological or otherwise. Outlines should be emailed to both the course instructors Jason Glynos (ljglyn@essex.ac.uk) and Yannis Stavrakakis (yanstavr@yahoo.co.uk) at least one week before the start of the course, so that they can be built into the programme and shared with other participants. Time is allocated at the end of each week for collective discussion of participant research topics and proposals. Course Aims & Objectives: Participants will become familiar with the basic assumptions, concepts and logics of poststructuralist discourse theory, exploring their implications for conducting social and political analysis. At the end of the course, participants will: be conversant with major literatures and debates in the field of discourse analysis; have acquired a solid grounding in poststructuralist discourse theory and its application to social and political analysis and critique; be well-grounded in theoretical and methodological issues arising in this field; be familiar with key dimensions of critical empirical research relevant to the design of a research strategy in this field; finish with a keen sense of the critical role that discourse plays both in theory and in social and political practice.

Course Content Spatial dependencies are a universal feature in the social sciences. Phenomena as diverse as the occurrence and outcomes of violent mass protests, policy learning and position taking in party competition, or the competitive setting of tax rates to attract foreign direct investment across neighbouring jurisdictions, all share a similar feature: actions taken by one actor are shaped in a theoretically meaningful way by the actions of one or more other actors. Spatial econometrics allows us to detect, model and estimate such interdependencies, and to work towards a causal interpretation of such relationships. The theoretical substance lies in the nature of interconnectedness between units, which can be geographic, economic, cultural, strategic etc., thus covering a wide ground of social science applications. This course begins with a data-oriented view of spatial patterns and dependencies in the data, then introduces a theory guided approach to building, estimating, and evaluating spatial and spatiotemporal regression models, and ends with a critical evaluation of the spatial approaches in the context of causal analysis. Course Objectives The course starts from the premise that interconnectedness is an important and theoretically meaningful feature of a broad range of phenomena in the social sciences. The main aim is therefore to enable students to identify and incorporate interconnected features in the study of their own data and areas of interest. This will involve learning how to detect spatial patterns, bringing data into a suitable format for spatial analysis, the estimation of structural parameters of spatial and spatiotemporal models and the presentation of effects. The materials provided in the labs will enable the students to undertake their own applied spatial project. Course Prerequisites All necessary background materials will be covered (in brief), though students will benefit most from the course if they have some understanding of regression analysis and a basic knowledge of matrix algebra and maximum likelihood, as well as some familiarity with R.

Social Science Research, 102805. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2022.102805 Course content The course shows how theoretical assumptions concerning measurement models and substantive models can be translated into a structural equation model, and how the model can be estimated and tested with the Mplus 8 computer program. In addition, we provide syntax for all examples in R (lavaan). We will show how to use R procedures that produce lavaan code from Mplus input (mplus2lavaan) and Mplus input, Mplus compatible data and output via R (MplusAutomation). In the first part, we deal with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which relates multiple indicators to one (CFA) or several latent variables (Simultaneous Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Bifactor Models and second order confirmatory factor analysis) and multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis. Different specifications of measurement models are tested via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as a special case of a structural equation model (SEM) and we will discuss scale building procedures, measurement invariance testing and adequate reliability and validity estimates. Special emphasis is given to the (cross cultural) analysis of multiple groups (MGCFA) for comparisons between groups and over time points (repeated cross-sections), including the assessment of measurement invariance (i.e., comparability of intercepts of observed variables and factor loadings) to compare regression coefficients and latent means. We also deal with the new procedures of measurement invariance testing (e.g., alignment optimization) to check approximate measurement invariance. The second part comprises both the structural model and the measurement model. Topics include recursive vs. non-recursive models for the structural part of the model, moderation (interaction effects) and mediation analyses, treatment missing and categorical data and the use of formative vs. reflective indicators in MIMIC Models. Again, special emphasis will be directed toward the use of the multiple-group option for cross-group comparisons of both the measurement and the structural model. A major focus will be the process of model modification and alternative model testing using adequate fit measures and how to report CFA and SEM results. We will draw all examples are from data of the European Social Survey (ESS) and use the concept of human values as operationalized by the Portrait Value Questionnaire developed by Schwartz for single country or cross-cultural analyses. Nonetheless, participants from all fields are welcome to participate. Course Objectives The objectives of this course are 1.to enable participants to use (multiple group) confirmatory factor analysis and (multiple group) structural equation modelling to develop and/or test both measurement models and scales and, furthermore, causal theories with latent variables. 2. to familiarize participants with the Mplus 8 program to handle the most important standard models. Nonetheless, to facilitate the transfer of the course content to other programs, all example syntaxes will also be supplied for R lavaan.. 3. to increase participantsâ competencies in the applications of the techniques and models with their own data, participants are highly encouraged to bring their own data as cleaned raw data files (see for input specifications of the data, e.g., Byrne 2012) and to use them for developing their models and projects for a dissertation or publications during the course. We will offer consultation hours from the beginning both by the instructor and the teaching assistant to answer individual questions and specially to support participants to perform analyses with their own data. Moreover, we will offer an open colloquium format to present and critically discuss the own research findings. Course Prerequisites Participants are expected to have extensive familiarity with Windows applications, good knowledge of exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis is required. The course is most optimal for those who want to apply CFA and SEM within the next twelve months. Remedial Reading T.

2B Quantitative Data Analysis and Statistical Graphics with R,https://essexsummerschool.com/summer-school-facts/courses/ess-2024-course-list/2b/,"Please note: This course will be delivered in person at the Colchester campus only. Online study is not available for this course. Martin Elff is Professor at Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen, Germany. He is a political scientist with research interests in political behaviour, comparative politics, and political methodology. His research appeared in various journals including the British Journal of Political Science and Political Analysis. He also published the R packages âmemiscâ, âmclogitâ, and âmunfoldâ on the âComprehensive R Archive Networkâ (http://cran.r-project.org) as well as a book on Data Management with R: A Guide for Social Scientists with SAGE. Course content The course introduces to quantitative social science data analysis using R. It focuses on the practical aspects of data analysis, including the management of social science data. It also shows how patterns within data can be visualised and how statistical models can be illustrated using appropriate diagrams. Consequently, the course cannot introduce basic or advanced statistical concepts, but such concepts are reviewed as appropriate. As far as possible, the contents of the course will be adapted to the existing statistical knowledge of the participants. However, it covers at least the following topics: (1) basic concepts of data analysis with R; (2) elementary programming techniques in R, (3) data management â working with variables and data frames; (4) summarising data using tables and graphics; (5) linear regression â model construction and interpretation; (6) generalised linear models for categorical responses, counts, and survival times; (7) advanced statistical graphics. In addition to these, a few more topics are optionally covered as time permits, such as principal components and factor analysis; structural equations models; random numbers and Monte Carlo simulations; linear algebra with R and regression in matrix form; multilevel models; advanced programming techniques â depending on participantsâ interests. Course objectives Participants who successfully complete this module will be able to bring their knowledge about statistical concepts and techniques to fruition in practical analyses. They will also know how to prepare data in a way suitable for this purpose, how to explore data with statistical graphics and how to present analysis results by means of tables and diagrams. Course prerequisites In order to gain the most from the course, participants ideally have an understanding of what kind of analysis they intend to conduct and require guidance on how to apply the relevant techniques using the open course software R. While the course may become helpful in acquiring new statistical concepts, it cannot teach them. Therefore participants should have a good understanding of linear regression and at least a basic understanding of any other method they want to put into practice with R. A certain level of âcomputer literacyâ will certainly be helpful. That is, participants should not be afraid of the command-line oriented (as opposed to menu-driven) software and of writing short command scripts. The ability to do this is not a prerequisite, but the motivation to learn it is. Representative Background Reading Long, JD, and Teetor, Paul.

She currently directs the Vivian A. and James L. Curtis Center for Health Equity Research and Training at the University of Michigan. Course Content Aspiring social scientists often wonder, âwhat is mixed methods research?â and âwhen should I use mixed methods in my research?â But before making decisions about using mixed methods research, other questions should be considered, such as âwhat is my philosophical stance?â and âwhat is my research question?â In this course, I will introduce students to mixed methods research in the social sciences. This course will provide depth and breadth on developing well-refined and theoretically driven mixed methods studies, along with guidance on using appropriate methods and instruments during data collection, integration, and analysis. The course content will be enhanced by an overview of both qualitative and quantitative methods, separately, then an examination of these methods together, and their valuable contributions to mixed methods research. The course provides (1) an introduction to mixed methods research; (2) an examination of the philosophical assumptions that guide the decision to use mixed methods research; (3) a context for data analysis and integration; and (4) a framework for drawing conclusions from mixed methods that inform future research, practice, and policy. A primary aspect of the course will be to teach students how to determine if mixed methods are necessary, given the problem statement and research questions.Â Â Â Course Objectives By the end of the course, students will be able to: (1.) Adopt a philosophical stance and highlight the major theoretical underpinnings guiding mixed methods research; (2.) Determine when someone should consider conducting a mixed methods study and understand the procedures for choosing a mixed methods design; (3.)

Marco Steenbergen has been a professor of political methodology at the University of Zurich since 2011. Prior to that, he held appointments at the University of Bern, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Carnegie Melon University. Marcoâs research covers methodology, as well as political psychology. He has published several books and articles in these areas. His current research focuses on electoral consideration sets, cleavages and identities, and new forms of political participation. Course content This course introduces methods of machine learning for social scientists. The broad objective of machine learning is to uncover patterns in data, either as an exploratory device or to make predictions. The course covers a variety of topics, including supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble learning. We discuss how the general principles of machine learning, as well as specific algorithms. The choice of technique, as well as application and interpretation take center stage in the course. Specific algorithms that will be dis-cussed include artificial neural networks, bagging, boosting, classification and regression trees, clustering, decision rules, k-nearest neighbors, principal components, probabilistic learning, random forests, regression, and support vector machines. General principles include cross-validation, global and local interpretation, loss functions, optimization, regularization, variable importance, and feature selection. Course Objectives Machine learning is of ever greater importance in the social sciences, both inside and outside of academia. The ultimate goal of this course is to make you conversant with the most important techniques and ideas of machine learning. This means that you have a good overview of the fields and its relevance for social scientific research. It also means that you have sufficient background knowledge to allow you to study further. This is important because 2-week course can only scratch the surface of machine learning, which evolves quickly. Being conversant with machine learning also means that you understand how to implement these methods, which we shall do in R. Note that the examples will be relatively small, with an eye on minimizing computation time. Where necessary, we shall discuss how to engage in big data analysis. Course Prerequisites This is an introductory course, meaning that prior familiarity with machine learning is not expected. Â It is useful if you have used the linear regression model before, as it is a starting point for much of the course. A basic knowledge of probability theory is indispensable, as is a working understanding of R. In R, you should know: (1) how to access various data sources; (2) the basic objects of the language; (3) basic operations; (4) the ability to compute descriptive statistics and create graphs; and (5) the basics of tidyverse.

Hybrid delivery of courses will include synchronous live sessions during which on campus and online students will be taught simultaneously. Johannes B. Gruber is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. His research explores the flow of information through media systems containing news, social and alternative media within the NEWSFLOWS project. Previously he worked at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam developing open-source research software within the OPTED project. He has developed or worked on software packages for web-scraping (traktok, paperboy, cookiemonster) text analysis (spacyr, quanteda.textmodels, stringdist, rwhatsapp, LexisNexisTools), and data storage (amcat4r). Course Content Social sciences are increasingly transforming into data driven disciplines. The main reasons for these developments are the availability of an abundance of high quality data on the internet and more commonly available skills in collecting, processing and storing these data to make them efficiently usable resources for high quality research. The course provides an introduction to the automated collection of data from the internet, as well as methods for efficient and safe data management. The first week covers different modes of storing data for individual researchers and research teams, and the theory and good practices behind them. This includes working with non-rectangular data and the creation of SQL and Elasticsearch databases for efficient data storage. The goal is to leave participants with a few good options to choose from and sufficient knowledge to make an informed choice for their next projects based on their needs and data structures. The first week also serves as an R refresher where need arises. The second week focuses on methods for collecting different kinds of data from the internet through various means. Specifically, we cover static web pages, how to use public Application Programming Interface (APIs), how to discover and employ hidden APIs and how to scrape dynamic web pages with browser automation tools. Along the way, the course covers the core technologies and data wrangling strategies involved in scraping and how to automate the processes to build large data collections over time. Course Objectives The internet has dramatically increased the availability of data for social science research. Online platforms and social media networks have provided vast amounts of data on human behaviour and interactions. Researchers can now access data on a scale that was previously unimaginable, including information on individualsâ opinions, behaviours, and relationships, which is additionally often more truthful and detailed than what participants would or could disclose in surveys. Additionally, advances in data analysis techniques and machine learning have made it possible to extract valuable insights from these large data sets. However, despite the abundance of data available on the internet, accessing and effectively utilizing it can prove to be challenging. How does one go about collecting information from web pages and online databases? And what is the best way to manage and store the massive amount of data that can be collected from the internet? These are the themes that this course will cover. Course Prerequisites Students are expected to have working knowledge of R at the beginning of the course. You do not need to be an expert in R as we will provide detailed explanations of all R code upon request. However, we cannot provide an introduction to R. If you want to refresh your knowledge in R, we recommend the freely accessible R for Data Science (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ãetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund (https://r4ds.hadley.nz a print version is also available). For example, you should be familiar with installing and loading packages and how to write and execute code in R (such as creating objects, etc.). Familiarity with internet technologies like HTML and HTTP is helpful, but not required. Representative Background Reading You are not required to do any prior reading. Papers with interesting or creative use cases for web scraping might be distributed closer to the course."

Chris Fariss is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and Faculty Associate in the Centre for Political Studies at the University of Michigan. Prior to beginning these appointments, he was the Jeffrey L. Hyde and Sharon D. Hyde and Political Science Board of Visitors Early Career Professor in Political Science in the Department of Political Science at Penn State University. He is also an Affiliated Scholar at the Security and Political Economy (SPEC) Lab at the University of Southern California. In June 2013, he graduated with a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, San Diego. He also studied at the University of North Texas, where I graduated with an M.S. in political science (2007), a B.F.A in drawing and painting (2005), and a B.A. in political science (2005). Chrisâs core research focuses on the politics and measurement of human rights, discrimination, violence, and repression. He uses computational methods to understand why governments around the world torture, maim, and kill individuals within their jurisdiction and the processes monitors use to observe and document these abuses. Other projects cover a broad array of themes but share a focus on computationally intensive methods and research design. These methodological tools, essential for analysing data at massive scale, open up new insights into the micro-foundations of state repression and the politics of measurement. Course description This course focuses on the research design and data analysis tools used to explore and understand social media and text data. The fundamentals of research design are the same throughout the social sciences, however the topical focus of this class is on computationally intensive data generating processes and the research designs used to understand and manipulate such data at scale. By massive or large scale, I mean that there are lots of subjects/connections/units/rows in the data (e.g., social network data like the kind available from twitter), or there are lots of variables/items/columns in the data (e.g., image or text data with many thousands of columns that represent the words in the document corpus), or the selected analytical tool is a computationally complex algorithm (e.g., a Bayesian simulation for modeling a latent variable, a random forest model for exploratory data analysis, or a neural network for automatically classifying new observations), or finally some combination of these three issues. The course will provide students with the tools to design observational studies and experimental interventions into large and unstructured data sets at increasingly massive scales and at different degrees of computational complexity. How will we go about learning these tools? In this class, we will learn to program and program to learn. What do I mean? First, we will use the R program environment to learn the building blocks of programming. These skills are essential for managing the increasingly large and complex datasets of interest to social scientists (e.g., image data, text data). As we develop programming skills in R, we will use them to help us understand how different types of data analysis tools work. For example, by the end of the course, students will be able to program and evaluate their own neural network or structural topic model from scratch. We will start very small and learn how to scale up. In the beginning of the course, we will not make use of many packages other than the base packages available by default in R. As we proceed, we will learn how models for data work before then investigating the functions that exist in the large, always increasing catalogue of packages available for you to use in R. The development of new functions in R is advancing rapidly. The tools you learn in this class will help you improve as a programmer and a data scientists but learning how to program and using your programming skills to learn how to analyse data. Course Objectives Students will learn how to design models for data that take advantage of the wealth of information contained in new massive scale online datasets such as data available from twitter, images, and the many newly digitized document corpuses now available online. The focus of the course is on learning to program in R with special attention paid to designing studies in such a way as to maximize the validity of inferences obtained from these complex datasets. 1. Learn to program models in R at a small scale using the base package and a minimal number of other packages. 2.Â Use the tools from research design to assist in model development 3. Validate models of observational data in comparison to an appropriate baseline model 4. Develop simulation based models for large scale, observational data 5. Develop and validate measurement (e.g., latent variable models, structural topic models) and classification models (e.g., neural networks) of text and image based data Course Prerequisites Students should have some familiarity with concepts from research design and statistics. Generally, exposure to these concepts occurs during the first year course at a typical PhD program in political science. Students should also have familiarity with the R computing environment. The more familiarity with R the better. Key textÂ (please note that ESS will provide a copy of this): Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson.

She has taught ethnographic and qualitative methods for over 25 years, including the Essex Summer School,Â the Swiss Summer School in Social Science Methods, in Lugano, and atÂ universities in the UK, Germany, Norway, and Hong Kong. Karen is a highly experienced ethnographer and qualitative researcher whose many publications include two widely cited books on ethnography: Ethnographic Methods (Routledge, 2nd ed. 2012) and Key Concepts in Ethnography (Sage, 2009). Karen provides training for the Social Research Association on a regular basis, as well as bespoke training in qualitative research methods. Her research is in the field of sociological understandings of lifestyle migration and harvest migration. Website: https://academics.org.uk/ProfKarenOreilly/ Course content Ethnography is an increasingly popular style of research, employed in both long-term and short-term studies in creative ways across the social sciences. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the technical, practical and philosophical issues that arise when employing traditional and innovative ethnographic methods. Ethnographers typically immerse themselves in a setting for a period of time, listen, ask questions; and supplement observation with the analysis of interview data, documents, and visual and digital data. Such an intrusion into the social setting presents a challenge to the âreceived view of scienceâ but ethnographic methods have proven, over time, to provide valid, valuable and rich contextual data with which to understand complex social issues. This course covers the following topics: participant observation and contemporary applications; hypotheses, abduction and serendipity; accessing the field; writing fieldnotes; making sense of observational data and telling credible stories; multi-sited, virtual, visual and sensory ethnography; applied ethnography; and reflexivity, ethics, and the emotions in fieldwork. The course is applied, encouraging participants to think intellectually about each topic area in relation to their own research interests, and to carry out and begin to analyse micro-observational studies. Course objectives By the end of the course participants should: Be confident to make close, theory-oriented observations through participation, observation, and conversation. Be equipped to record and analyse the data produced through diverse methods. Take a critical and creative approach to ethnographic methods and understand how they can be combined with other methods of data collection for a range of social, political and policy research areas. Take a reflexive and ethical approach to ethnographic encounters. Be in a position to present and defend the quality and value of ethnographic interpretations. Course Prerequisites The course is introductory but intensive, rapidly taking participants from a beginnerâs to an advanced level. Some prior familiarity with qualitative methods and a background knowledge of the philosophy of social science is required. Participants should be aware that the practical decisions to be made when conducting ethnographic research are necessarily theoretically-informed and will vary with each practitionerâs disciplinary orientation. The course aims to equip participants with the knowledge required to make those decisions for themselves in practice.

Course Content This course offers a comprehensive discussion of various (new and established) machine learning techniques for prediction and causal effect estimation (ATE, ATT, CATE, ITE) with observational data. The course will cover relevant techniques in machine learning from the basics (e.g., Lasso, decision and boosted trees) to more advanced topics (e.g., random forest, causal forest, meta-learners, neural-networks, double machine learning), and how they can be harnessed for effective causal estimation. Best practices in the field will be followed throughout the course, hence the content will also cover how to evaluate obtained models and select among different modelling options. The course will combine the theory from lectures with practical (hands-on data) sessions in the statistical software R. Practical sessions will use well-established data sets or ad-hoc simulated data to apply the methods presented in the lectures with practical examples. The main goal of the course is to equip participants with the latest machine learning techniques to conduct data visualisation and causal analysis independently. By the end of the course, the participants will know the challenges that come with observational data and know how to address them through good practice to obtain robust causal estimates. Prior knowledge of causal estimation and machine learning is not necessary as those topics will be revised at the beginning of the course. However, thorough understanding of statistical modelling is imperative to fully appreciate the course content. Course Objectives By the end of the course the students will: Know the basic principles of causal inference and machine learning. Be aware of advantages as well as challenges that come with observational data. Understand the role of modelling in causal inference.

He received his Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University. Course Content In this course, students will learn the logic and methods of policy evaluation. We will focus on good research designs that answer important causal questions in public policy. In doing so, we will review the technical skills necessary to conduct credible empirical research such as field experiments, differences-in-differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity designs. More importantly, we will practice the thinking necessary to develop and evaluate good research designs. Class sessions will involve a combination of lecture and discussion. Some sessions will review a particular set of empirical methods in detail, others will involve the detailed discussion of a single paper, and others will involve a mix of lecture and discussion revolving around a substantive topic in policy evaluation. Students are expected to prepare for each class session and participate in the discussions. Course Objectives 1. Students will be able to design advanced policy evaluations with quantitative methods. In particular, they will be able to correctly apply i) regression discontinuity designs, ii) instrumental variable designs, and iii) difference-in-difference designs. 2. Students should be able to critically evaluate the empirical soundness of existing policy evaluations. Course Prerequisites Students are expected to have taken at least one graduate level course in statistics. Only a basic familiarity with probability, hypothesis testing, and regression is assumed. The course will conduct statistical analyses using the R programming language. No prior experience in computer coding is necessary. The Instructor and/or teaching assistant will hold special sessions to introduce R.

He is co-author of the scaling method textbookÂ Analyzing Spatial Models of Choice and JudgmentÂ (2nd Ed. 2020), as well as many articles on related methods and applications. Course Content This course focuses on methods toÂ discover, understand and visualize latent patterns in dataÂ and is especially suited to students with projects using survey data and other forms of relational data used in political science, sociology, economics, business, marketing, and psychology. The course introduces students to measurement theory and methods of scaling techniques, integratingÂ Multidimensional Scaling, Item Response Theory, and Ideal Point Estimation. The first part of the course will provide an overview of the foundations of these techniques and introduce students to the most common methods for scaling and âspatialâ analysis and the visualization of latent patterns in survey and behaviour data. Key themes of the course include: How can we estimate preferences, traits, and other difficult-to-measure concepts? How can we improve comparability of latent concepts across survey respondents, or across separate surveys? How can we reduce complex behavioural data to its basic underlying dimensions? The course will demonstrate how to interpret, measure, and visualize latent dimensions of data via a variety of scaling methods using the open-source programming language R. The course will also discuss a range of applications these methods to social science studies of relational and perception data derived from elite behaviour and surveys, especially for identifying latent preferences of political, economic and social actors. The course concludes with discussions of the most recent advances in the field, including applications for text analysis, and practical advice for those seeking to use such methods in social science research, relevant to the students enrolled. The course first covers how to analyse data from scales found in surveys (such as Likert-type scales), focusing on surveys that ask respondents to place themselves and / or stimuli on issue or attribute scales. The course begins with approaches to scaling to generate bias-adjusted and latent spatial data from survey responses, such as the Aldrich-McKelvey scaling and âBasic Spaceâ scaling with Anchoring Vignettes as methods for addressing perceptual bias in the form of âDifferential Item Functioning.âÂ The course next examines similarities data and rating scale data from surveys (such as favourability scales for stimuli such as politicians or social groups) using multidimensional scaling (MDS), such as the SMACOF optimization method implemented in R and Bayesian applications to Metric Multidimensional Scaling. Finally, the course provides an overview of Item Response Theory and ideal point estimation, generally focused on binary choice data, which includes those used in âroll call votingâ analysis of elite behaviour in parliaments and courts. Here we will cover Poole and Rosenthalâs W-NOMINATE and Pooleâs Optimal Classification unfolding method, as well as a variety of Bayesian analysis techniques for binary and ordinal choice data using Item Response Theory (IRT). An extensive range of Bayesian techniques is discussed, including Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling, Ordinal and Dynamic Item Response Theory, Bayesian Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Bayesian Unfolding. The final section will discuss recent methods for scaling to a variety of different data types, including text data and the latest computation innovations to apply scaling methods to large-scale data sets. This course will enable students to derive latent spatial preference information and/or a dimensional structure from various types of survey and behaviour data, which is applicable to a wide range of social science applications, academic and non-academic alike. Consumers of research based on these methods will also benefit from a deeper understanding of this type of methodology, its potential and its limitations. Data types covered for scaling, IRT and/or ideal point applications include: Survey Response Data, including issue opinions, placements and Likert Scales Perceptual, Preferential, and Similarities Data Elite behaviour and choice data (e.g., âroll callâ voting in legislatures and courts) Text Data Â Course Objectives Students will learn to use various computational methods to generate measures of ideology and preferences and understand the latent dimensional properties of social science data, including surveys and legislative data. Students will understand the theories behind these methods and the relationships between Item Response Theory, Ideal Point Estimation and other scaling methods. As these techniques are fundamental parts of much recent work in social science, students will be able to both understand and produce this research based on measuring concepts in this way. In addition, students will be able to: Understand the fundamentals of measurement theory and scaling techniques, Explain the advantages and limitations of various scaling techniques Demonstrate proficiency in using relevant software packages in R Identify appropriate methods of measurement for a given set of data. Analyse the results of measurement techniques and present them visually. Â Course Prerequisites The course is designed to be accessible to social science graduate students of all backgrounds. However, students familiar with the R programming environment will find it easier to adapt to course content and assignments, so it is recommended to become familiar with the basic structure of the R syntax and the Rstudio software prior to enrolling. The 1-day Introduction to R offered the Sunday before the first day of class at ESS is recommended for this purpose. In addition, the course assumes some basic familiarity with general statistics (OLS and MLE). Reading: Armstrong, D. A., Bakker, R., Carroll, R., Hare, C., Poole, K. T., & Rosenthal, H. (2020).

Darren Schreiberâs research centers on emergence and complexity in political systems. In his first career as an attorney, Darren specialized in federal litigation and had his first federal jury trial at age 23. While earning his Ph.D. in Political Science at UCLA, Darren developed an agent-based computer simulation of the formation and dynamics of political parties. He has pioneered the subfield of neuropolitics with the first use of functional brain imaging (fMRI) to study the neural foundations of politics. He is currently a Senior Lecturer in Politics at the University of Exeter, his previous appointments were at Central European University in Budapest, Hungary; University of California, San Diego; and the University of Pennsylvania. Course Content Though models sit at the center of lines of social inquiry as diverse as game theory, statistical analysis, qualitative analysis, and political philosophy, all involve an attempt to describe core elements of the world in a way that helps us to understand, value, and predict that world. With Agent Based Models, computer simulations of the behaviors of many agents work deductively from simplified assumptions to creates dynamic interactions that can be examined over a range of conditions to make inductive arguments about the nature of the world. In this generative reasoning approach, agents with very simple micromotives can lead to complex adaptive systems in which qualitatively different macrobehaviors emerge. How do very simple assumptions about drivers, city dwellers, and voters lead to complex emergent phenomena like traffic jams, housing segregation, and party realignment? In this course, we will answer these questions by building models of these problems and beginning to develop our own agent based models. Course Objectives By the end of this course, students will learn to turn a rough idea about a social science phenomenon into an account of the agents, behaviors, environments, and their interactions that can then be modeled in NetLogo. In addition to learning about modeling, students will be capable of using concepts and code from existing models, of turning their concepts into code, and of analyzing and evaluating the models that they create. NetLogo is designed as a low threshold framework that is easy to begin working with and has a high ceiling with extensive capabilities for sophisticated modeling. Course Prerequisites This is an introductory course with no prerequisites. The programming language Logo was developed to teach young children a simple way to write code. This course will use its descendant NetLogo to create agent-based models and there is no need for any familiarity with programming or anything beyond basic computer using skills.

Course Content Images and text are among the most common data materials in the social and behavioural sciences, Over the past two decades, our ability to learn patterns in these types of data has grown by leaps and bounds thanks to advances in deep learning. Deep learning methods engage layers of hidden nodes to extract data representations. They play a crucial role in natural language processing, image processing, and the analysis of video. As such, they are quickly becoming an indispensable tool in the social and behavioural sciences for the classification of texts, images, and videos. In this course, you will get hands on experience in programming deep learning algorithms in Python. After learning the basics of Python and deep learning, we will build our own classifiers and use state-of-the-art pre-trained models. A focus will be given to convolutional neural networks for images and transformers and embeddings for natural language processing. After describing the logic and architecture of the algorithms, you will have a chance to gain hands-on experience programming them using Python under the supervision of expert programmers. Course Objectives To learn the basic principles of Python programming.
